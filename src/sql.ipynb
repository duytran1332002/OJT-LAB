      "émile gilliéron émile gilliéron (1850–1924) was a swiss artist and archaeological draftsman best known for his reconstructions of mycenaean and minoan artifacts from the bronze age. education and experience émile gilliéron studied at the trade school in basel from 1872 to 1874, the art academy in munich from 1875 to 1876, and finally at the studio of isidore pils in paris from 1875 to 1877. in 1877, gilliéron relocated to athens where he began his career as an archaeological artist who produced drawings for greek and foreign excavators, designed commemorative postage stamps for the inaugural olympic games (1896 and 1906), and served as an art tutor for the royal family of george i. professional life émile gilliéron worked as an archaeological illustrator for heinrich schliemann and gained a reputation for being widely recognized as the best archaeological illustrator working in greece at the time. this reputation helped gilliéron acquire a position assisting with fresco reconstructions at the excavation at tiryns from 1910-1912. gilliéron also became the chief restorer for arthur evans at the palace of minos at knossos on crete. for over three decades, gilliéron worked with his son, and predecessor, also named émile, creating reproductions of frescoes and other artifacts for arthur evans. the gilliérons can be recognized as contributing many illustrations to evan's four-volume book, the palace of minos at knossos. some of the most famous reconstructions by the gilliérons include the priest king fresco, the ladies in blue fresco, and the painting of the throne room at the palace of minos. émile gilliéron and his son formed a family business known as e. gillieron & son where they sold original commissioned watercolors and other reproductions made directly from originals on skoufa street in athens. the gilliérons created replicas of metal artifacts based on molds of the original masks, weapons, and vessels. they also created full-scale copies of minoan frescoes on watercolor paper and created three-dimensional reconstructions in plaster form. by 1911 the gilliérons had a catalog of mycenaean antiquities consisting of over 144 pieces that could be manufactured in germany by the wurtemburg electro plate company. the gilliérons reworked molds taken from original antiquities to recreate an object in its undamaged form. the gilliérons created two reconstructions of the well-known “mask of agamemnon” from shaft grave v in grave circle a at mycenae, one which represented how the mask looked when it was found, and one restored to look like the believed original appearance. criticisms the work of the gilliérons can be attributed to influencing the spread of aegean art and creating an impression of minoan culture but the validity of the reconstructions has long been debated. the priest king fresco, believed by arthur evans to depict one of the rulers of ancient knossos, was created by piecing fragments of the original together and has been scrutinized as containing contemporary influences that were allegedly much different from the original. other reconstructions by the gilliérons fall under similar scrutiny, such as the bull leapers fresco, which may have been given the addition of a modern border. émile gilliéron's reconstruction of the saffron gatherer fresco has been proven to be incorrect, as it originally depicted a monkey, not a boy. in addition to restorations and reconstructions, it has been a matter of ongoing research whether the gilliérons were also involved in the forgery business producing fakes with their greek assistants. some of the artifacts attributed to the gilliérons and under suspicion of forgery include the chryselephantine snake goddesses, the ring of minos and the ring of nestor, and the well-known phaistos disc on crete. death and acknowledgements émile gilliéron made and sold reproductions to museums and private collections all over the world up until his death in 1939. since then the national museum in athens has had a gallery devoted to gilliéron’s replicas of the greek bronze age. despite scrutiny of validity and questions of forgery, his reproductions remain valuable representations of ancient artistic achievements.\n",

which folded in 1982; in 1988 he founded guía hípica, which folded in 2007. in 2005 la cadena capriles founded urbe and the sports publication líder and acquired urbe bikini; in 2009, it founded el mundo economía y negocios.other media enterprises currently owned by la cadena capriles include la cadena multicolor and planetaurbetv. changes in the newspaper until 1999, the visual format of últimas noticias did not follow any particular formula and according to one commentator, the newspaper looked disorganized. but as of october 2000, certain new parameters were laid down in an effort to make the layout simpler and better organized. at the same time the newspaper adopted a more colloquial tone and aimed to be more of a guide to daily life.in mid-2002 the newspaper began printing in colour on every page. between 2004 and 2006 it launched four regional editions (for different areas of greater caracas) in addition to the national one.between 2009 and 2011, últimas noticias became a major multimedia operation, with its website providing an abundance of material, including podcasts, videos, video chats, interviews, sound galleries, and the like. últimas noticias radio presents music and interviews around the clock. launched the first news app in the country and develop its own low cost tablet.in 2013 the british financier robert hanson bought ultimas noticias for his private company hanson family holdings for a figure reported as $us98 million. in 2014, he was accused by newspaper staff of turning it into \"a socialist party mouthpiece\", but the editor, hector davila, replied that his only instructions from hanson were \"to run a balanced and profitable newspaper\". pre-2013 sale marcos ruiz, a reporter for últimas noticias, was one of a group of journalists handing out leaflets in caracas in favor of press freedom on august 13, 2009, when he was set upon by at least four supporters of president hugo chávez, who punched and beat him with clubs. according to últimas noticias, “12 journalists employed by its newspaper group were injured. the paper ran a front-page headline declaring: \"enough with the violence!”. reporters attacked according to pen, the other journalists attacked on august 13 included manuel alejandro álvarez, césar batiz, greasi bolaños, sergio moreno gonzález, octavio hernandez, jesús hurtado, gabriela iribarren, glexis pastran, fernando peñalver, and marie rondón, all of them employees of la cadena capriles. “the journalists, who were wearing press credentials, were protesting against the government's approval of a new education law that would restrict press freedom”, noted pen. “the assailants reportedly hit and kicked the journalists, leaving them seriously injured, as well as accusing them of being 'defenders of the oligarchy' in the 'people's territory'. the government reportedly issued a statement condemning the attack and the attorney general started an investigation. however, as of 21 august only one suspect had been arrested, despite the fact that there are reportedly photos of the attack that should make it easy to identify the others. according to local news reports, the assailants work for the government-owned broadcaster avilatv. government officials, including president chávez, have reportedly accused the 12 journalists who were attacked of being 'provocative' and taking a 'political stand,' leading them to fear action that the attorney general may take action against them\".césar batiz investigated the assassination of journalist orel sambrano, who at the time of his murder had been writing columns about the rise in drug trafficking, and has written (in collaboration with jesus yajure) about the failure of police to arrest suspects in the killing of journalist, film producer, and entrepreneur jacinto lopez. criticism of venezuelan government últimas noticias published a great deal of investigative journalism that has placed it at odds with the administration of hugo chávez. among an example of this is an august 2011 exposé by césar batiz of derwick associates, a firm accused of bribery and overbilling and currently the target of several lawsuits in the united states.at a meeting of his council of ministers in may 2012, chávez accused últimas noticias of manipulating information concerning the announcement of his presidential candidacy. “first i get this copy where it says 'chávez will announce his candidacy between june 1 and 11'”, said chávez. “and later i receive another copy ... and the headline says: 'chávez still doesn't know when he will announce his candidacy'. so i ask myself: why did they change the headline? what are they trying to manipulate?'”. últimas noticias explained that it publishes six editions a day and that headlines are frequently changed from one edition to the next in order to improve on clarity. the second headline chávez saw had in fact appeared in that day's first edition, while the first headline he saw had appeared in the other five editions. post-2013 sale in 2013, últimas noticias was sold to a party then unidentified and commentary criticizing the venezuelan government declined. this was supposedly due to the new owners of útimas noticias being close to the venezuelan government. it later transpired that the new owner was the british financier robert hanson. censorship allegations following alleged censorship by the newspapers director during the 2014 venezuelan protests, chief researcher tamoa calzadilla along with others resigned. nathalie alvaray, the first woman media vp in the country and leader of all the innovation and convergence projects resigned a week beforein january 2015, venezuelans responded on social media to the controversial headline, \"maduro's tour was a success\", portraying that president nicolas maduro's meeting with saudi arabia was successful despite other outlets calling it a failure. the title led to venezuelans making their own satirical headlines criticizing the newspaper's allegedly biased title.\n",
